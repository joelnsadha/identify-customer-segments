Identifying customer segments with Arvato is a key component of the Udacity Data Science Nanodegree project. AZ Direct and Arvato Financial Solutions have furnished two datasets: one containing demographic data for the German populace and another with similar information for customers of a mail-order sales firm. Our approach involves utilizing unsupervised learning methodologies on demographic and expenditure data from a sample of German households. We preprocess the data, employ dimensionality reduction techniques, and utilize clustering algorithms to partition customers, aiming to enhance customer outreach for a mail order company.

We scrutinize the interrelations among demographic features, categorize the population into clusters, and assess the prevalence of customers within each segment.

It's important to note that we cannot disclose the data provided by Arvato Financial Services due to contractual obligations. However, the notebook contains both the code and analyses performed on the datasets.

Requirements:
This project necessitates Python 3.x along with the following Python libraries:

- NumPy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Scikit-learn
- Seaborn

Additionally, you'll need software to run and execute an iPython Notebook.

File Details:
- Identify_Customer_Segments.ipynb: A Jupyter Notebook segmented for completing the project, providing comprehensive details beyond this summary.
- Data: Contains the following files:
  - Udacity_AZDIAS_Subset.csv: Demographic data for the general German population; 891,211 individuals (rows) x 85 attributes (columns).
  - Udacity_CUSTOMERS_Subset.csv: Demographic data for a mail-order company's customers; 191,652 individuals (rows) x 85 attributes (columns).
  - Data_Dictionary.md: Detailed information regarding the features in the datasets provided.
  - AZDIAS_Feature_Summary.csv: A summary of feature attributes for demographic data; 85 features (rows) x 4 columns.

Each row in the demographic files corresponds to a single person, including information beyond individuals, such as household, building, and neighborhood details. We leverage this information to cluster the general populace into groups with similar demographic characteristics, subsequently assessing how individuals in the customer dataset align with these created clusters. The objective is to identify over-represented clusters in the customer data compared to the general population, which are assumed to constitute the core user base. This insight can then inform further applications, such as targeted marketing campaigns.
